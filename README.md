## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that attempting to do the entire website in one go is not the way to go. Take a 5 minute break every so often and you will come back to the project refreshed. At the end of the project you will feel more fulfilled and not as drained as if you did the project all in one session!
