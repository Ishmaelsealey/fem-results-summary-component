# Information Regarding the project

Estimated time to complete: 4 hours, 30 mins
Due to me using vim while coding this project, I will take a bit longer to get used to vim.

Use a general class for the different sections to have identical styling.
Mobile first design.

Use sass and add varibles for all the colors in the style guide. Place everything in a `<main>` container and place a class on that container such that it will adjust its position when going to the desktop version.

Ensure everything is in an appropriate tag in html before beginning to style.
